                I've been playing baseball for as long as I remember. I enjoy this activity because I can stay in shape while also meeting new teammates. I participate in this activity by playing for Austin High during the spring and playing for my select team in the summer.

            I started playing chess over quarantine. I enjoy this activity because it challenges me to think ahead and plan out my moves. I also like the fact that no 2 games will be the same, so it doesn't get repetitive. I participate in this activity by playing on chess.com and playing over the board with my family.

            I started investing in the stock market when I was about 12 years old. I enjoy this activity because it allows me to manage my own money while also accepting the risk of doing so. I participate in this activity by watching CNBC to stay up to date on stocks around the world and then purchasing them through Charles Schwab.
