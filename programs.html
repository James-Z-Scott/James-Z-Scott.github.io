            This program is similar to the popular online game Agar.io. In this game, you control the yellow ball. Your goal is to eat as much food (the little dots) as possible while also killing and avioding enemies (the other big spheres on the map). You can kill an enemy if you have more mass than them when you collide, but watch out because your enemies can also kill you! The goal of the game is to be the last sphere alive. HAVE FUN!
